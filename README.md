# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code (ABOUT.md)

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the `Develop` folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in the ABOUT.md file, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
